## The task is to reach a test accuracy of 805 on CIFAR-10 dataset using advanced convolutions and soe of the constraints in this model to acheive the 805 accuracy are as below
## 1. Total Receptive Field must be more than 44
## 2. Total parameters to be less than 1Million
## 3. Use Depthwise Sepaerable Convolutions
## 4. Use Dilated Convolutions
